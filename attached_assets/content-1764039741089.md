## "10/10 would recommend Matt as tennis coach to take private lessons from! He has been one of the greatest coaches I have had in my adult tennis career. I definitely recommend him for advanced level players! (and beginners too!)"

- ## I took about a 10 year hiatus from playing tennis, but Matt works with me to strengthen basic skills and reteach some outdated techniques that I learned as a kid. Each clinic is a good mix of drills, strategy building, and specific skill practice. I would recommend Matt as a coach for any level, but be warned that tennis is an addictive hobby.

- ## A first-time tennis player here. I took several private and group classes with Matt as my instructor and they all were great learning sessions as well as super fun! He is a wonderful instructor and provides useful insight during all sessions to help his students improve their technique and enjoy the game of tennis. He is very responsive and flexible in scheduling & is also super fun and easy to talk to! I recommend his classes to anyone and recommended him to all my friends and family!





Beliz

- ## As an adult, I decided to pick up tennis last year. I started going to Matt’s clinics and his knowledge and expertise was wonderful. I decided to do private lessons so that I could focus on my weak areas. Matt’s explanations and modeling of tennis form are great. Not only is he patient to explain, but he is also quick to do a small correction to help your game even more. After months with Matt, I am prepared enough to join USTA league play as a beginner! Matt has now catered our lessons for match play. His ability to adapt and change with you is incredible. From where I started to where I am now (and hope to go to) has been in result to working with Matt. As an adult, it can be intimidating to start a new sport. However, with Matt’s lessons and guidance, I am comfortable playing with other players and truly enjoying the game of tennis! 100/10 recommend!
